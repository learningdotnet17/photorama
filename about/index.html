Hello visitor! My name is Brijesh Chawla and I am the owner of this website. I like to play with my camera and lenses and pretend I am a photographer. 
<br>
<br>
A lot of people ask me if I have a YouTube channel (no!) or an Instagram account (yes!). I find it easier to give them my website instead.
<br>
<br>
I like to shoot landscapes, cityscapes, nightscapes, long exposures, birds, and some macro - for flowers. Waterfalls, people, not so much.
<br>
<br>
Currently (late 2020) I use a Sony A7rIII body with an assortment of lenses. I was in love with the Canon 16-35 f/4 lens for a while. These days I am loving the 35-70 focal length quite a bit.
<br>
<br>
I love shooting lighthouses, and sunsets, and lighthouses at sunsets. Love water bodies of any kind - lakes, rivers, ponds, oceans.
<br>
<br>
Hope you like these pictures. Drop me a line to say hi.
